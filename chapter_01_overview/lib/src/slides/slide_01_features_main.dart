    '''Serverpod is a complete, competent backend for Flutter. Apart from being just a server, Serverpod incorporates many common tasks that are otherwise cumbersome to implement or require external services.

It provides you with world-class logging capabilities. You no longer need to search through endless server logs. Pinpoint exceptions and slow database queries in an easy-to-use user interface with a single click. 

It comes with a high-performance distributed cache built right in. Any serializable objects can be cached locally on your server or using Redis if you need to use the same cache across a cluster of servers.

It comes with a complete database migration system that helps you apply and version changes to the database. With Serverpod's ORM, your queries use native Dart types and null-safety. There is a straight path from your statically checked code to the database.''';
