It has gained substantial popularity among Flutter developers since its initial stable release in January. The framework comes with many features that make it faster to get things done, debug your code, and deploy your server. It automatically generates your protocol and client-side code by analyzing your server. Calling a remote endpoint is as easy as making a local method call.';
