  notes: '''In this section, we'll be delving into the fundamentals of working with models in Serverpod. Models serve as the foundation for defining serializable classes, which are essential for generating Dart code for both the server and client sides. We'll explore how to define classes, specifying fields and supported types, as well as how to limit the visibility of generated classes, ensuring sensitive information remains on the server side. Additionally, we'll learn about creating exceptions and custom enums, enhancing the flexibility of our applications. Moving forward, we'll delve into the generated code, discovering how Serverpod automates tasks like object copying with 'copyWith', serialization with 'toJson' and 'fromJson', and even how to add custom methods using Dart's extension feature. With these key concepts, we'll gain a deeper understanding of how to effectively leverage Serverpod to build robust and efficient Flutter applications.''',
