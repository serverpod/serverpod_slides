Endpoints are the connection points to the server from the client. 

- With Serverpod, you add methods to your endpoint, and your client code will be generated. 

- For the code to be generated, you need to place your endpoint in the "endpoints" directory of your server.

- Your endpoint should extend the "Endpoint" class. 

- For methods to be generated, they need to return a typed Future, and its first parameter should be a Session object. 

- The Session object holds information about the call being made and provides access to the database.''';
