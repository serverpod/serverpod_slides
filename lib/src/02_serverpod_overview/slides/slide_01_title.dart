  notes: "Serverpod is an open-source, scalable app server written in Dart for "
      "the Flutter community. It has gained a lot of traction among Flutter "
      "developers since its initial stable release a year ago - there are now "
      "over 5000 Serverpod developers. The framework comes with many features "
      "that make it faster to get things done, debug your code, and deploy "
      "your server. It automatically generates your protocol and client-side "
      "code by analyzing your server. Calling a remote endpoint is as easy as "
      "making a local method call. And, of course, best of all, you can write "
      "your entire backend in Dart and even share code between your app and "
      "server.",
